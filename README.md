DESCRIPTION:
API Integration – The Bridge of Data Exchange
An API serves as a bridge that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Instead of manually collecting or processing data, APIs enable systems to fetch, send, and exchange data seamlessly. For example, when a weather forecasting system integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API or NOAA’s climate API, it gains access to real-time and historical data, such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed, without needing to build a weather station itself. This saves time, reduces cost, and improves accuracy.
Data Visualization – Turning Raw Data into Insights
While APIs provide the data, data visualization transforms it into interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs that make sense to humans. Raw datasets are often overwhelming, especially when dealing with millions of entries. Visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio, or custom-built dashboards using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn help in interpreting patterns, correlations, and trends quickly
